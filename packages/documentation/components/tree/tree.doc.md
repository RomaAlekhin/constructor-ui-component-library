Used to visualize the value hierarchy.
The parent value that has children is marked with an arrow.
If the parent is collapsed, the arrow is facing to the right.
If the parent is expanded, the arrow faces down.
You can only select an element that is not a parent and does not contain other child elements.
If the parent is in the disabled state, you cannot expand it.
Multiple selection of items is only available when using the Tree with checkbox.
